Description

For my final project I will create a simple 2D game with visual studios. I was thinking of creating a game like Space Invaders.

Features

Things like:
Text
Movement
Creating New Windows
Color Manipulation
Spawning In/Deleting Objects

Challenges

Figuring out how to create enemy AI movement/abilities
Figuring out multiple level phases

Outcomes

I might not have the ability to fully recreate Space Invaders. So I might have to simplify the game in certain areas.
